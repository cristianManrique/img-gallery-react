# img-gallery-react
Create a nice Images Gallery with React JS

## Getting Started
Project - build a small app displaying a responsive, dynamic picture gallery..

### Prerequisites
- git
- Node
- npm

### Installing
- git clone https://github.com/cristianManrique/img-gallery-react.git
- npm install -save
- npm start

## Minimum requirements
1. Display a dynamic picture gallery (note that images must not be hardcoded, but instead
generated dynamically). You can use images from free stocks or even showcase your
personal photos :)
2. Picture gallery must be responsive (you can use any CSS technique to achieve that)
3. Javascript plugin usage is prohibited.

## Optional requirements
1. Implement any user interactivity on a gallery (click and show info, remove a picture,
reorder pictures, upload user pictures that will be automatically added to the gallery,
etc.).
2. Fetch images from any API using search input from a user (Imgur, Unsplash, etc.). You
are allowed to use AJAX library in this case.

## Explain solution
- I choose React.js to create this web app. It's easy and faster.
- I create style with css custom (not framework).
- I create methods like React practice.
- User can delete and add new image to gallery.

## @TODO LIST:
- Create a method to modified image information (title, url, etc..).
- create a filter by category of image (ex: action, love, funny etc..).
- More responsive
